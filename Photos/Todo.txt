GENERAL
-------------------------------------------------------------
+   Create a schedule system that executes jobs (classes?) asyncronously. IE Partner stats should be updated every fifteen minutes. 
    Currently these are done by update-scenario events resetting the stats and the stats only updating every 15 mins. Not ideal, gets messy if an update-scenario is missed out, and adds uncessary code.


PARTNERS UPGRADE
-------------------------------------------------------------
